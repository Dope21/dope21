## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full-Stack Developer based in Thailand who loves exploring new knowledge beyond my expertise, hoping one day to be better than that. I want to explore so much that I don't know where to start and end up procrastinating instead.

## Especially Interested In
- **High Performance Computing**: It just sounds cool, I don't know anything about it though.
- **System Design**: I like to talk about it, please ask me anything.
- **Solution Architect**: A position I aim to be. Why? Because it sounds cool, of course.
